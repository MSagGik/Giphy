# Giphy
The Giphy exchange rate application is a service that provides data on the dynamics of the exchange rates of the US dollar, euro and Chinese yuan against the Russian ruble.
Depending on the dynamics of the exchange rate of the ruble, this service randomly displays an image in the “gif” format corresponding to the mood of the changing exchange rate.
By clicking on the image, it can be viewed in more detail in a separate window.
If the ruble is growing relative to other currencies, then the random “gif” image corresponds to the mood of feeling financially successful.
And if the ruble falls relative to other currencies, then the random “gif” image corresponds to the mood of feeling financial insolvency.
The application has the ability to select a currency. The current date set in the mobile device is also displayed.
